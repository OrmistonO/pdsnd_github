### Project Title
Programming for Data Science with Python

### Description
In this project Python is used to explore data related to the bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Bikeshare.py code imports the data to answer interesting questions about it by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. This script also takes in user input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
